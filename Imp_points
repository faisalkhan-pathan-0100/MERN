#Babel
  - Babel is a tool that transforms modern JavaScript code into backward-compatible versions for older browsers.
  - It compiles newer syntax/features into older JavaScript
  - Since it transforms JavaScript to JavaScript (different versions), it is also called a transpiler (source-to-source compiler).
  - So, Babel is both a compiler and a transpiler.

Quick definitions:
  Compiler: Translates code from one language to another (e.g., Java to bytecode).
  Transpiler: Translates code from one version of a language to another version of the same language.

# A valid React component can return only one element(<h1>one element</h1>), which can be a single HTML element, a
React fragment(<>  </> ), or a component containing multiple elements
