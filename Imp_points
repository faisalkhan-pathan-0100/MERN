# what is pure component class?
  A PureComponent class in React is a special type of class component that automatically implements a shallow comparison of props and state to optimize rendering.

#Babel
  - Babel is a tool that transforms modern JavaScript code into backward-compatible versions for older browsers.
  - It compiles newer syntax/features into older JavaScript
  - Since it transforms JavaScript to JavaScript (different versions), it is also called a transpiler (source-to-source compiler).
  - So, Babel is both a compiler and a transpiler.

Quick definitions:
  Compiler: Translates code from one language to another (e.g., Java to bytecode).
  Transpiler: Translates code from one version of a language to another version of the same language.

# A valid React component can return only one element(<h1>one element</h1>), which can be a single HTML element, a
React fragment(<>  </> ), or a component containing multiple elements

#StrictMode
- StrictMode is a tool in React that helps highlight potential issues in an application.
- It activates additional checks and warnings for deprecated APIs, unsafe lifecycles, unexpected side effects, and other problems.
- It does not render any UI and only runs in development mode.

- ex,
    ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root')
    );

#shape validation
In React, to validate an object prop with specific properties, you use PropTypes.shape().

Example:
 
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  user: PropTypes.shape({
    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    age: PropTypes.number,
  }).isRequired,
};

#Reconciliation
  - Reconciliation is the process of comparing and updating the virtual DOM
  - Reconciliation occurs when a component's state or props change, or when a component mounts or
unmounts.
- ReactJS uses a depth-first search algorithm for reconciliation

#What is a Higher-Order Component?
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a React component as an argument and returns a new enhanced component.
